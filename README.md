# AI Code Assistant: Context-Aware Development Tool

## Overview

We've built a sophisticated AI-powered coding assistant that integrates with Continue.dev to provide context-aware responses for development tasks. The system learns from your coding conversations and becomes smarter over time, making it perfect for training custom Small Language Models (SLMs) for specific projects.

## 1. What Are AI Agents?

**AI Agents** are autonomous programs that can:
- **Perceive** their environment (your code, conversations, context)
- **Reason** about problems using available information
- **Act** by providing relevant solutions based on past experiences
- **Learn** from interactions to improve future responses

### Our Agent's Capabilities:
- 🧠 **Context Understanding**: Analyzes your current coding session
- 🔍 **Smart Retrieval**: Finds relevant past solutions from your project history
- 🎯 **Task Detection**: Automatically identifies if you're debugging, implementing, or explaining code
- 📚 **Knowledge Building**: Stores conversations for future reference and SLM training

## 2. Multi-Model Architecture

### Available Models:

#### **Local Models (Fast & Private)**
- **Gemma 3 4B**: Lightning-fast responses for quick questions
- **Nomic Embed Text**: Converts text to vectors for similarity search

#### **Cloud Models (High Quality)**
- **GPT-4**: Advanced reasoning for complex coding tasks
- **Claude 3 Sonnet**: Excellent for code review and explanation

#### **Smart Routing System**
```yaml
# Automatic model selection based on:
X-Use-Case: "quick_answers" → Gemma (Local)
X-Priority: "quality" → GPT-4/Claude (Cloud)
X-Task-Type: "debug" → Fast local model
X-Task-Type: "implement" → High-quality cloud model
```

### Why Multiple Models?
- **Cost Efficiency**: Use free local models for simple queries
- **Performance**: Route complex tasks to powerful cloud models
- **Privacy**: Keep sensitive code discussions local when needed

## 3. Context Fetching: The Smart Memory System

### How We Find Relevant Context:

#### **Vector Similarity Search**
```python
# 1. Convert your question to a vector
question_vector = embed("How do I fix this authentication error?")

# 2. Search similar past conversations
similar_contexts = vector_db.search(
    vector=question_vector,
    project="ai_code_assistant",
    limit=3
)
```

#### **What Gets Stored:**
- 🗣️ **Question-Answer Pairs**: Complete Q&A conversations
- 🐛 **Error Patterns**: Debugging sessions and solutions
- 📝 **Code Snippets**: Implementation examples
- 📚 **Library Usage**: Import patterns and framework usage

#### **Context Enhancement Pipeline:**
1. **Analyze** your current message for code, errors, libraries
2. **Search** for similar past conversations in your project
3. **Retrieve** recent messages from your current session
4. **Inject** relevant context into the AI prompt
5. **Generate** response with full project knowledge

### Example Context Injection:
```
You are an expert Python developer with access to previous conversations.

Project: ai_code_assistant
Session: debug_fastapi_auth_2024_06_10

### Similar Previous Conversations:
**Example 1** (relevance: 0.89):
Q: FastAPI authentication middleware not working
A: You need to add the middleware to the app instance...

### Recent Conversation History:
User: I'm getting 401 errors on protected routes
Assistant: Let's check your JWT token validation...

Instructions:
- Reference previous solutions when relevant
- Consider error patterns and debugging context
```

## 4. Session-Based Chat History

### Session Management:

#### **Session Structure:**
```
Project: ai_code_assistant
├── Session: debug_session_001
│   ├── Message 1: "Auth middleware issue"
│   ├── Message 2: "Try adding dependency injection"
│   └── Message 3: "Perfect! That worked"
├── Session: feature_user_management
│   ├── Message 1: "How to add user roles?"
│   └── Message 2: "Here's a role-based system..."
```

#### **How Sessions Work:**
1. **Manual Session Control**: You set `X-Session-ID` in Continue.dev config
2. **Conversation Isolation**: Each session maintains its own context
3. **Recent History**: AI remembers recent messages within the same session
4. **Cross-Session Learning**: Can find similar solutions from other sessions

#### **Session Benefits:**
- 🎯 **Focused Context**: Only relevant conversation history
- 🧵 **Thread Continuity**: AI remembers what you discussed earlier
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: See how conversations evolve
- 🎓 **Learning Isolation**: Different topics don't interfere

### Retrieving Session History:
```bash
# Get all messages from a specific session
GET /sessions/ai_code_assistant/dev_user_001/debug_session_001

# Returns chronological conversation flow
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "FastAPI auth error..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's check your middleware..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Still getting 401s..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Try this JWT validation..."}
  ]
}
```
