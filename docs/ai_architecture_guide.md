# AI-Powered Code Development Architecture Guide

## üìã Questions

1. **Migration from Anthropic to ChatGPT**: If I am using anthropic and I want to migrate the artifacts to chatgpt, how to do this? Is it easy? Does it need some mappings? Are there some models which are compatible? I want this to happen because later when maintenance is done I will have to export these and feed it to a small learning model as a knowledge base for easy maintenance.

2. **UI vs API Token Usage**: If I use UI and API does it make any difference in number of tokens in models? Do I get more tokens if I do not use UI? I know I have more control but does it make it less expensive to use if I use APIs directly?

3. **Multiple Agents Shared Memory**: What is Multiple agents shared memory? => LangGraph

4. **Claude Project Memory via API**: How to mimic claude project via claude api? Like it still has some memory from old chat but it's a new one.

5. **Best AI Integration for Code Development**: Best AI integrated for code development with code editor like VS Code.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

**Core Problem Statement**: Multiple devs will come and use the AI integrated code development in VS Code or somewhere on a website. All the calls will go to a Virtual machine and then will call the model. The model maybe a paid model like OpenAI, Anthropic or a opensource self deployed model like LLaMA or DeepSeek. The response of the model will be saved and also given back to the devs. The saved response can be starred and exported later as a knowledge base for maintenance.

## üí° Expert Recommendations

### Startup-Scalable, Modular Approach

Here's a comprehensive answer to each of the 5 questions, tailored to the core architecture goal:

#### 1. **Anthropic to ChatGPT Artifact Migration**

**Problem**: You use Claude (Anthropic) today and want to switch later to ChatGPT/OpenAI ‚Äî will your saved conversations, prompts, or artifacts transfer cleanly?

**Answer**: Yes, but you'll need lightweight normalization.

**Solution**:
- Save all interactions in a standard format:
```json
{
  "user": "What's the time complexity of merge sort?",
  "model": "O(n log n)",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-07T10:00:00",
  "model_used": "Claude-3",
  "tags": ["algorithms", "interview"],
  "starred": true
}
```

- Avoid vendor-specific memory structures or metadata
- Use your own JSON schema or logging structure
- Later, just re-route it to GPT-4-Turbo or any other model

Claude and GPT may differ in how system prompts or memory context works, but raw Q&A can be reused easily for:
- RAG
- Fine-tuning
- Retrieval-based memory (like LangChain + vector DB)

**Tool Tip**: Use a central memory service (Redis or Postgres) to manage stored artifacts ‚Äî not tied to Claude or GPT internally.

#### 2. **UI vs API ‚Äî Token Control & Cost**

**Problem**: Does using API directly give more control or reduce token usage compared to UI?

**Answer**: Yes. API gives you full control and is cheaper.

| Mode | Token Limit | Cost | Control |
|------|-------------|------|---------|
| Web UI (ChatGPT/Claude) | ~128K tokens | Fixed pricing (e.g. $20/mo) | Low |
| API (GPT/Claude) | Up to 128K (Claude), 128K (GPT-4 Turbo) | Pay-per-token | High |

**Recommendation**:
- Use API only in your app
- Budget: Claude Opus ‚âà $15/1M input tokens, GPT-4 Turbo ‚âà $10/1M input
- You can:
  - Compress context
  - Choose which parts to send
  - Avoid sending full history every time

**Pro Tip**: Use token trimming + chunking tools (like LangChain's `TokenTextSplitter`) to optimize payloads.

#### 3. **What is Shared Memory with Multiple Agents?**

In **LangGraph**, "multiple agents shared memory" means:
- You have multiple LLM-powered agents doing different things (e.g., Refactorer, BugFixer)
- They all read/write to a shared memory (like a knowledge graph, or a dict in Python)

**Example**:
```python
shared_memory = {
    "code_context": "def add(a, b): return a + b",
    "user_goal": "optimize code",
    "last_response": "Try using numpy for speed."
}
```

Each agent gets this memory and updates it.

**Use in your case**:
- Let each dev session be one LangGraph instance
- Shared memory = project context + starred suggestions
- Helps in chaining actions (e.g., ask, fix, refactor, document)

#### 4. **Mimic Claude Project-like Memory Using API**

Claude UI feels like it "remembers" chats because it's storing past threads. You can mimic this:

**Solution**: Maintain a session store:
```json
{
  "session_id": "user1-20250607",
  "history": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How to fix this bug?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Try changing the index..."}
  ]
}
```

Then pass history in the `messages` payload when calling Claude/GPT:
```json
"messages": [
  {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."},
  ...
]
```

Use **Redis** or **Postgres** to store and query this memory.

#### 5. **Best AI for Code in VS Code (Lean & Scalable)**

**Best Option**: **[Continue.dev](https://continue.dev/)**

| Feature | Why it's Good |
|---------|---------------|
| VS Code integration | ‚úÖ Native support |
| Supports multiple backends | ‚úÖ OpenAI, Claude, LLaMA |
| Extendable & open-source | ‚úÖ You can plug your own API server |
| Central routing possible | ‚úÖ Add middleware in your VM |

**Implementation**:
- Dev installs Continue extension in VS Code
- You configure it to send API calls to your central VM
- VM uses a FastAPI + router:
  - `/api/ask`: routes to GPT or Claude
  - `/api/save`: logs Q&A
  - `/api/star`: marks favorites
- Store responses in Postgres/JSON + vector store for RAG/export

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendations

- Use **Continue.dev + FastAPI** for lean MVP
- Start with **Claude or OpenAI**, but **log and normalize everything** so migration is painless
- Build a **modular logging + export pipeline** early ‚Äî it will serve both **maintenance** and **RAG/chatbot use**
- Keep **APIs over UIs** for cost control and flexibility

## üìö Learning Path

### Key Technologies to Master

1. **LangSmith**: For logging + metadata extraction which will be used by SLMs in maintenance. LangSmith can log all interactions and let users inspect/star/export.

2. **LangGraph**: For Shared Memory Across Multiple Agents

### Next Steps

Would you like a sample `FastAPI` backend for routing, saving, and starring responses as a starting template?
